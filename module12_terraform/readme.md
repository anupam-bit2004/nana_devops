What is terraform:

1. Automates and manage you infrastructure
2. open source and declarative (define WHAT end result you want)
3. Helps in provisioning infrastructure

Terraform architecture:
1. Has 2 main components - "core" and "providers"
2. Core uses 2 input sources --> config file , terraform state
3. Core --> based on input sources decides what needs to be created / updated and destroyed
